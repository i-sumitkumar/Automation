Instructions (Follow These Precisely):
1.  Locate Relevant Information:
  â€¢  Carefully scan the research paper to find references for statement (1) and statement (2).
  â€¢  If no direct reference is found, provide the closest related information and clarify the reasoning.
2.  Use "Chain of Thought" Reasoning:
  â€¢  Think step by step before answering.
  â€¢  Break down whether each statement is explicitly supported or contradicted in the research paper.
  â€¢  Explain the reasoning behind each decision.
  â€¢  Prefer literal interpretations of statements unless the paper clearly supports broader inference.
3.  Cite Evidence from the Paper:
  â€¢  Provide a direct quote or paraphrase from the research paper to justify your answer.
  â€¢  If paraphrasing or inferring, clearly state that it differs from the paperâ€™s wording and verify that the meaning still matches precisely.
  â€¢  Definitions must match paper terminology exactly â€” avoid casual synonyms unless explicitly supported by the paper.
4.  Verify Logical Consistency:
  â€¢  Double-check if any assumptions, contradictions, or alternative interpretations exist.
  â€¢  If conflicting evidence is found, mention it explicitly before making a final decision.
  â€¢   If a statement contains vague or ambiguous terms, highlight them and explain why they may lead to misinterpretation.
  â€¢  Do not assume meaning from partial matches or surface similarity. Avoid guessing based on keyword overlap.
5.  Final Answer (Provide in This Format):
  â€¢  Answer Choice: (a/b/c/d)
  â€¢  Explanation: [Clear and structured reasoning]
  â€¢  Evidence: ["Direct quote or page reference from the paper"]
ðŸš¨ Important:
  â€¢  If the answer is uncertain or ambiguous, state the reason instead of guessing.
  â€¢  If additional context from the paper is needed to clarify, indicate that too.
  â€¢  Apply standard rounding rules (round half up) for numerical answers. Do not align with suggested options unless mathematically justified.
  â€¢  If the paper lacks enough evidence, say so â€” do not infer beyond whatâ€™s written.
  â€¢  Avoid keyword-matching or assuming terms mean the same unless clearly stated in the paper.
