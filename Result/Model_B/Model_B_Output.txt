Example of code clones human raters of the clones proposed by automated tools did rarely agree upon what constitutes a clone worth to be removed. While the sources of inter-rater difference could be the insufÔ¨Åcient similarity among clones or the appraisal of the need for removal, the study still highlights that there is no clear consensus yet, even for task- speciÔ¨Åc deÔ¨Ånitions of clones. Another small study was performed at the Dagstuhl seminar 06301 ‚ÄúDuplication, Redundancy, and Similarity in Software‚Äù 2007. Cory Kapser elicited judgments and discussions from world experts regarding what characteristics deÔ¨Åne a code clone. Less than half of the clone candidates he presented to these experts had 80% agree- ment amongst the judges. Judges appeared to differ primarily in their criteria for judgment rather than their interpretation of the clone candidates. 2.3 Types of Clones Program-text clones can be compared on the basis of the program text that has been copied. We can distinguish the following types of clones accordingly: ‚Ä¢ Type 1 is an exact copy without modiÔ¨Åcations (except for whitespace and com- ments). ‚Ä¢ Type 2 is a syntactically identical copy; only variable, type, or function identi- Ô¨Åers have been changed. ‚Ä¢ Type 3 is a copy with further modiÔ¨Åcations; statements have been changed, added, or removed. Baker further distinguishes so called parameterized clones [28], which are a subset of type-2 clones. Two code fragments A and B are a parameterized clone pair if there is a bijective mapping from A‚Äôs identiÔ¨Åers onto B‚Äôs identiÔ¨Åers that allows an identiÔ¨Åer substitution in A resulting in A‚Ä≤ and A‚Ä≤ is a type-1 clone to B (and vice versa).
line range of 4‚Äì6 and 10‚Äì12, respectively. The semantic difference is that the Ô¨Årst segment sets a global variable whereas the second one a local variable. The common abstract behavior of the two code segments is to iterate over a data structure and to increase a variable in each step. Program-text similarity is most often the result of copy&paste; that is, the pro- grammer selects a code fragment and copies it to another location. Sometimes, these programmers are forced to copy because of limitations of the programming lan- guage. In other cases, they intend to reuse code. Sometimes these clones are modiÔ¨Åed slightly to adapt them to their new environment or purpose. Clearly, the deÔ¨Ånition of redundancy, similarity, and cloning in software is still an open issue. There is little consensus in this matter. A study by Walenstein et al. [532], for instance, reports on differences among different human raters for clone candidates. In this study, clones were to be identiÔ¨Åed that ought to be removed and Walenstein et al. gave guidelines towards clones worthwhile being removed. The 18 R. Koschke 1 i n t sum = 0; 2 3 void foo ( I t e r a t o r i t e r ){ 4 for ( item = f i r s t ( i t e r ) ; has_more ( i t e r ) ; item = next ( i t e r ) ) { 5 sum = sum + value ( item ) ; 6 } 7 } 8 i n t bar ( I t e r a t o r i t e r ){ 9 i n t sum = 0; 10 for ( item = f i r s t ( i t e r ) ; has_more ( i t e r ) ; item = next ( i t e r ) ) { 11 sum = sum + value ( item ) ; 12 } 13 }
associated with removing code clones [128]. The removal requires deep semantic analyses and it is difÔ¨Åcult to make any guarantees that the removal does not introduce errors. There may be even orga- nizational reasons to copy code. Code cloning could, for instance, be used to disen- tangle development units [128]. The current debate lacks empirical studies on the costs and beneÔ¨Åts of code cloning. There are very few empirical studies that explore the interrelationship of code cloning and maintainability. All of them focus on code cloning and errors as one (out of many) maintainability aspect. Monden et al. [374] analyzed a large system consisting of about 2,000 modules written in 1 MLOC lines of Cobol code over a period of 20 years. They used a token- based clone detector (cf. Section 2.8.2) to Ô¨Ånd clones that were at least 30 lines long. They searched for correlations of maximal clone length with change frequency and number of errors. They found that most errors were reported for modules with clones of at least 200 lines. They also found many errors‚Äîalthough less than in those with longer clones‚Äîin modules with shorter clones up to 50 lines. Yet, interestingly enough, they found the lowest error rate for modules with clones of 50 to 100 lines. Monden et al. have not further analyzed why these maintainability factors correlate in such a way with code cloning. Chou et al. [113] investigated the hypothesis that if a function, Ô¨Åle, or directory has one error, it is more likely that is has others. They found in their analysis of the Linux and OpenBSD kernels that this phenomenon can be observed most often where programmer ignorance of interface or system rules combines with copy-and-paste. They explain the correlation of bugs and copy-and-paste primarily by programmer ignorance, but they also note that‚Äîin addition to ignorance‚Äîthe prevalence of copy- and-paste error clustering among different device drivers and versions suggests that programmersbelieve that ‚Äúworking‚Äù code is correct code. They note that if the copied

Null-pointer checking and error handling can be found by CCFinder almost equally well. Tracing and memory error handling can best be found by PDG-DUP. 2.10 Clone Presentation Because there is typically a huge amount of clones in large systems and these clones differ in various attributes (type, degree of similarity, length, etc.), presentation issues of clone information are critical. This huge information space must be made accessi- ble to a human analyst. The analyst needs a holistic view that combines source code views and architectural views. There have been several proposals for clone visualization. Scatter plots‚Äîalso known as dot plots‚Äîare two-dimensional charts where all software units are listed on both axes [114, 156, 512] (cf. Fig. 2.3). There is a dot if two software units are similar. The granularity of software units may differ. It can range from single lines to functions to classes and Ô¨Åles to packages and subsystems. Visual patterns of cloning may be observed by a human analyst. A problem with this approach is scalability for many software units and the order of the listed software units as this has an impact on the visual patterns. While there is a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù order for lines (i.e., lexical order) within a Ô¨Åle, it is not clear how to order more coarse-grained units such as functions, Ô¨Åles, and packages. Lexical order of their names is in most cases as arbitrary as random order.
in terms of recall and precision. The syntax-based technique by Baxter had the highest precision (100%) and the lowest recall (9%) in this experiment. Kamiya‚Äôs technique had the highest recall and a precision comparable to the other techniques (72%). The re-implementation of Merlo‚Äôs metric-based technique showed the least precision (63%). Although the case study by Bailey and Burd showed interesting initial results, it was conducted on only one relatively small system (16 KLOC). However, because the size was limited, Bailey was able to validate all clone candidates. A subsequent larger study was conducted by Bellon and Koschke [54, 55]. Their likewise quantitative comparison of clone detectors was conducted for 4 Java and 4 C systems in the range of totaling almost 850 KLOC. The participants and their clone detectors evaluated are listed in Table 2.3. Table 2.4 summarizes the Ô¨Åndings of Bellon and Koschke‚Äôs study. Row clone type lists the type of clones the respective clone detector Ô¨Ånds (for clone types, see Section 2.3). The next two rows qualify the tools in terms of their time and space consumption. The data is reported at an ordinal scale ‚àí‚àí, ‚àí, +, + + where ‚àí‚àíis worst (the exact measures can be found in the paper to this study [54, 55]).

Output:
Answer Choice: b
Explanation:
1. Analyzing Statement (1) "Every redundant code is a clone":
   - The research paper discusses various types of code clones, including exact copies and syntactically identical copies with minor modifications. However, it does not explicitly state that all redundant code qualifies as a clone. Redundant code could include non-clone repetitive code that does not meet the strict definitions of cloning provided (such as exact copies or syntactically identical copies). Therefore, without explicit confirmation from the paper that all redundant code is considered a clone, we cannot assume statement (1) to be true.
   - Evidence: The paper details different types of clones (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) and discusses the complexity and disagreement among experts on what constitutes a clone, suggesting that not all redundant code may be classified as a clone.

2. Analyzing Statement (2) "The value of the silhouette metric cannot exceed 1":
   - The silhouette metric is a measure used in various fields, including data clustering, to assess the validity of the clustering. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher value indicates that objects are well matched to their own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. This metric is not discussed in the provided research paper; however, it is a well-established fact in statistical analysis and clustering techniques that the silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1.
   - Evidence: Although the silhouette metric is not mentioned in the paper, its definition and range are standard in statistical literature.

Final Decision:
- Statement (1) is False because the paper does not confirm that all redundant code is considered a clone.
- Statement (2) is True based on the established range of the silhouette metric in statistical analysis, despite not being mentioned in the paper.

Therefore, the correct answer is b. (1) is False and (2) is True.

Evidence:
- Every redundant code is a clone
- The value of the silhouette metric cannot exceed 1

Ground Truth: 
Output:
1. Locate Relevant Information:
- Statement (1): "Every redundant code is a clone."
- Statement (2): "The value of the silhouette metric cannot exceed 1."

2. Use "Chain of Thought" Reasoning:
- For statement (1), we need to find information related to redundancy and clones in the research paper.
- For statement (2), we need to look for any mention of the silhouette metric and its possible range in the paper.

3. Cite Evidence from the Paper:
- For statement (1), the paper discusses code clones and redundancy but does not explicitly state that every redundant code is a clone. It mentions that there is no clear consensus on what constitutes a clone worth removing, indicating variability in definitions.
- For statement (2), the paper does not directly mention the silhouette metric or its specific range. Therefore, we need to infer based on the absence of information.

4. Verify Logical Consistency:
- There is no direct evidence in the paper to support statement (1) as true. The lack of consensus on defining clones suggests that not all redundant code may be clones.
- The absence of information on the silhouette metric's range does not contradict the statement that its value cannot exceed 1. However, without explicit confirmation, we cannot definitively say it is true.

5. Final Answer:
- Answer Choice: c. (1) and (2) are False
- Explanation: The paper does not support the statement that every redundant code is a clone, and there is no direct reference to the silhouette metric's maximum value.
- Evidence: The paper does not provide explicit support for either statement.

Evidence:
- Every redundant code is a clone.
- The value of the silhouette metric cannot exceed 1.

Example of code clones human raters of the clones proposed by automated tools did rarely agree upon what constitutes a clone worth to be removed. While the sources of inter-rater difference could be the insufÔ¨Åcient similarity among clones or the appraisal of the need for removal, the study still highlights that there is no clear consensus yet, even for task- speciÔ¨Åc deÔ¨Ånitions of clones. Another small study was performed at the Dagstuhl seminar 06301 ‚ÄúDuplication, Redundancy, and Similarity in Software‚Äù 2007. Cory Kapser elicited judgments and discussions from world experts regarding what characteristics deÔ¨Åne a code clone. Less than half of the clone candidates he presented to these experts had 80% agree- ment amongst the judges. Judges appeared to differ primarily in their criteria for judgment rather than their interpretation of the clone candidates. 2.3 Types of Clones Program-text clones can be compared on the basis of the program text that has been copied. We can distinguish the following types of clones accordingly: ‚Ä¢ Type 1 is an exact copy without modiÔ¨Åcations (except for whitespace and com- ments). ‚Ä¢ Type 2 is a syntactically identical copy; only variable, type, or function identi- Ô¨Åers have been changed. ‚Ä¢ Type 3 is a copy with further modiÔ¨Åcations; statements have been changed, added, or removed. Baker further distinguishes so called parameterized clones [28], which are a subset of type-2 clones. Two code fragments A and B are a parameterized clone pair if there is a bijective mapping from A‚Äôs identiÔ¨Åers onto B‚Äôs identiÔ¨Åers that allows an identiÔ¨Åer substitution in A resulting in A‚Ä≤ and A‚Ä≤ is a type-1 clone to B (and vice versa).
line range of 4‚Äì6 and 10‚Äì12, respectively. The semantic difference is that the Ô¨Årst segment sets a global variable whereas the second one a local variable. The common abstract behavior of the two code segments is to iterate over a data structure and to increase a variable in each step. Program-text similarity is most often the result of copy&paste; that is, the pro- grammer selects a code fragment and copies it to another location. Sometimes, these programmers are forced to copy because of limitations of the programming lan- guage. In other cases, they intend to reuse code. Sometimes these clones are modiÔ¨Åed slightly to adapt them to their new environment or purpose. Clearly, the deÔ¨Ånition of redundancy, similarity, and cloning in software is still an open issue. There is little consensus in this matter. A study by Walenstein et al. [532], for instance, reports on differences among different human raters for clone candidates. In this study, clones were to be identiÔ¨Åed that ought to be removed and Walenstein et al. gave guidelines towards clones worthwhile being removed. The 18 R.

associated with removing code clones [128]. The removal requires deep semantic analyses and it is difÔ¨Åcult to make any guarantees that the removal does not introduce errors. There may be even orga- nizational reasons to copy code. Code cloning could, for instance, be used to disen- tangle development units [128]. The current debate lacks empirical studies on the costs and beneÔ¨Åts of code cloning. There are very few empirical studies that explore the interrelationship of code cloning and maintainability. All of them focus on code cloning and errors as one (out of many) maintainability aspect. Monden et al. [374] analyzed a large system consisting of about 2,000 modules written in 1 MLOC lines of Cobol code over a period of 20 years. They used a token- based clone detector (cf. Section 2.8.2) to Ô¨Ånd clones that were at least 30 lines long. They searched for correlations of maximal clone length with change frequency and number of errors. They found that most errors were reported for modules with clones of at least 200 lines. They also found many errors‚Äîalthough less than in those with longer clones‚Äîin modules with shorter clones up to 50 lines. Yet, interestingly enough, they found the lowest error rate for modules with clones of 50 to 100 lines. Monden et al. have not further analyzed why these maintainability factors correlate in such a way with code cloning. Chou et al. [113] investigated the hypothesis that if a function, Ô¨Åle, or directory has one error, it is more likely that is has others. They found in their analysis of the Linux and OpenBSD kernels that this phenomenon can be observed most often where programmer ignorance of interface or system rules combines with copy-and-paste. They explain the correlation of bugs and copy-and-paste primarily by programmer ignorance, but they also note that‚Äîin addition to ignorance‚Äîthe prevalence of copy- and-paste error clustering among different device drivers and versions suggests that programmersbelieve that ‚Äúworking‚Äù code is correct code. They note that if the copied

In their case study, they used CCFinder‚Äî Kamiya‚Äôs [263] tool evaluated in other case studies, too‚Äîone of the Bauhaus2 clone detectors, namely ccdiml, which is a variation of Baxter‚Äôs technique [47], and the PDG-based detector PDG-DUP by Komondoor [286].

Null-pointer checking and error handling can be found by CCFinder almost equally well. Tracing and memory error handling can best be found by PDG-DUP. 2.10 Clone Presentation Because there is typically a huge amount of clones in large systems and these clones differ in various attributes (type, degree of similarity, length, etc.), presentation issues of clone information are critical. This huge information space must be made accessi- ble to a human analyst. The analyst needs a holistic view that combines source code views and architectural views. There have been several proposals for clone visualization. Scatter plots‚Äîalso known as dot plots‚Äîare two-dimensional charts where all software units are listed on both axes [114, 156, 512] (cf. Fig. 2.3). There is a dot if two software units are similar. The granularity of software units may differ. It can range from single lines to functions to classes and Ô¨Åles to packages and subsystems. Visual patterns of cloning may be observed by a human analyst. A problem with this approach is scalability for many software units and the order of the listed software units as this has an impact on the visual patterns. While there is a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù order for lines (i.e., lexical order) within a Ô¨Åle, it is not clear how to order more coarse-grained units such as functions, Ô¨Åles, and packages. Lexical order of their names is in most cases as arbitrary as random order.
in terms of recall and precision. The syntax-based technique by Baxter had the highest precision (100%) and the lowest recall (9%) in this experiment. Kamiya‚Äôs technique had the highest recall and a precision comparable to the other techniques (72%). The re-implementation of Merlo‚Äôs metric-based technique showed the least precision (63%). Although the case study by Bailey and Burd showed interesting initial results, it was conducted on only one relatively small system (16 KLOC). However, because the size was limited, Bailey was able to validate all clone candidates. A subsequent larger study was conducted by Bellon and Koschke [54, 55]. Their likewise quantitative comparison of clone detectors was conducted for 4 Java and 4 C systems in the range of totaling almost 850 KLOC. The participants and their clone detectors evaluated are listed in Table 2.3. Table 2.4 summarizes the Ô¨Åndings of Bellon and Koschke‚Äôs study. Row clone type lists the type of clones the respective clone detector Ô¨Ånds (for clone types, see Section 2.3). The next two rows qualify the tools in terms of their time and space consumption. The data is reported at an ordinal scale ‚àí‚àí, ‚àí, +, + + where ‚àí‚àíis worst (the exact measures can be found in the paper to this study [54, 55]). Recall and precision are determined as in Bailey and Burd‚Äôs study by comparing the clone Table 2.3. Participating scientists Participant Tool Comparison Brenda S. Baker [29] Dup Token Ira D.
